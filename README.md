# NASDAQ-stock-prices
NASDAQ CURRENT STOCK PRICES console application

1) Set up your own API key in nasdaq.php (first lines) to make it work! The link is given in the comment there.
2) Use stock symbols as arguments, not full names of companies!

Example of a console command: php nasdaq.php msft (will give you the current price of a microsoft stock).
